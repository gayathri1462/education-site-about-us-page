                      The teaching role of faculty members reflects their centrality in addressing the primary educational mission among colleges and universities. As faculty members teach, they disseminate and import basic or applied knowledge to
                      students
                      and assist students with the learning process and applying the knowledge. In this construction of the teaching role, the teacher is the content expert, and students are regarded as learners or novices to the academic discipline
                      or field
                      of study. Faculty members are expected to follow developments in the field so their expertise and knowledge base remain current. At many universities, faculty members are also expected to participate in creating the new
                      developments
                      that are taught, which sometimes leads to tensions about appropriate priorities for research and teaching roles.
